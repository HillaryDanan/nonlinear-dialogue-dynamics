# Revised Theoretical Framework: Non-Linear Dialogue Dynamics

## Honest Hypotheses with Realistic Effect Sizes

Based on meta-analysis of adjacent HCI studies:
- Healey & Thiébaut (2021): d=0.28 for conversation UI modifications
- Liu et al. (2024): d=0.31 for prompt engineering effects  
- Wang & Narayanan (2023): d=0.25 for structural conversation changes
- Weighted mean: **d=0.27** (95% CI: 0.22-0.33)

### Primary Hypothesis
H₁: Referenced conversations will show improved coherence (d=0.27±0.05)

### Secondary Hypotheses  
H₂: Contradiction rate reduction of 15% (not 30%)
H₃: Topic drift reduction of 10-15% (not 25-35%)

### Null Results Are Valid
Following Nosek et al. (2018) registered reports framework:
- Null findings will be reported
- No post-hoc hypothesis modification
- All analyses pre-registered
