# Study Limitations

## Technical Constraints
- API access only - no access to model attention weights
- Prompt length varies between conditions (~7x difference)
- Limited to GPT-3.5, Claude-3, and Gemini models

## Design Limitations  
- Within-subjects design susceptible to order effects
- Single researcher coding (no inter-rater reliability yet)
- Observational study - cannot establish causation

## Statistical Considerations
- Multiple comparisons (12 tests) requiring Bonferroni correction
- Effect size estimates based on adjacent literature (dâ‰ˆ0.27)
- Power analysis suggests n=64 for 80% power with corrected alpha
